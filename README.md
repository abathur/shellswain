Shellswain publishes events to power event-driven bash profile/bashrc scripts.

Don't depend on it, yet.

It works well enough to be the cornerstone of my own bash profile, but I haven't sorted out how I want to handle public/private APIs yet; I assume I'll end up renaming some or all of the functions.

Shellswain depends on bash 5 and https://github.com/bashup/events.
